It is possible to bind a tokenized card to a buyer when it is being created.
There are a few ways to do so.

## Associate by `buyer_id`

The easiest way to associate a buyer to a card is to pass along a `buyer_id`
when creating a card.

This will find a buyer with that `id` and associate the card to it. If a buyer
with that `id` could not be found it's ignored.

        "buyer_id": "fe26475d-ec3e-4884-9553-f7356683f7f9"
      }'
```

  <TabItem value="node">

```js
const request = new CardRequest();
request.method = "card";
request.number = "4111111111111111";
request.expirationDate = "11/25";
request.securityCode = "123";
request.buyerId = "fe26475d-ec3e-4884-9553-f7356683f7f9";

const paymentMethod = await client.storePaymentMethod(request);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Associate by `buyer_external_identifier`

Alternatively, a card can be associated to a buyer by it's
`external_identifier`. If a buyer with that `external_identifier` could not be
found it's ignored.
