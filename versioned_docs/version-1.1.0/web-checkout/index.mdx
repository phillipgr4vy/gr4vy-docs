Welcome to Gr4vy. In this guide we will run you through all the steps needed to
get set up with Gr4vy as your web checkout experience.

<Image src={embed} title="The Gr4vy Embed checkout experience" />

1. [We will create an API key][1] which is needed to generate the signed JWT client token in step 2.
2. [We will set up a server-side SDK][2] to generate a client token for 
   authenticating to the Gr4vy API.
3. [And finally we will add **Gr4vy Embed**][3] which will handle the capture of
   the payment method details.
