Gr4vy's **Universal 3-D Secure** can also be used with your own, external, 3-D
Secure MPI.

## Usage

To use 3-D Secure with your own MPI, we assume you have handled the 3-D Secure
on your end and have collected the relevant data received at the end of the
flow.

The `POST /transactions` API supports directly passing 3-D Secure data as part
of the transaction request. We will pass this data along to the payment service
assuming it this data via their API.

:::caution Payment service compatibility

Not all payment services support external 3-D Secure data, and therefore even
when this data is provided we still expect a `redirect_url` as well. If none of
the selected payment services support the pass-through of 3-D Secure data the
Gr4vy API might [return a pending transaction](hosted) with an `approval_url` in
the response.
