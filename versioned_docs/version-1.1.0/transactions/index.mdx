In Gr4vy a transaction represents a payment made using a
[payment method](/payment-methods) using any kind of payment instrument like a
card or PayPal.

## Features

The transactions API can be used to:

- Create a transaction using a card
- Create a transaction using a PayPal
- Store a card used in a transaction so that it can be used again later
- Associate a transaction to a buyer
- Further authorize, capture, or refund a previously created transaction

:::note Using Gr4vy Embed

There is little need to use these APIs directly if you are using [Gr4vy Embed]
instead. [Gr4vy Embed] automatically creates transactions against these APIs and
can even bind them to a previously created buyer.
