A payment method's `status` value can be one of the following depending on the
state within Gr4vy and the status within the used payment service.

| `status`                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `processing`              | The payment method record has been created in Gr4vy and is now being processed with your payment services.                                                                                                           |
| `processing_failed`       | The payment method could not be processed with any payment service due to technical issues.                                                                                                                          |
| `buyer_approval_pending`  | The payment method was created but needs approval from the buyer. This is mainly used in alternative payment methods like PayPal where the user needs to be redirected to PayPal to complete the payment method.     |
| `buyer_approval_declined` | The payment method was created and needed approval from the buyer, but the buyer declined the approval.                                                                                                              |
| `buyer_approval_timedout` | The payment method was created and needed approval from the buyer, but the buyer failed to approve the payment method before it timed out. Most approvals time out after 1 hour but this might change in the future. |
| `stored`                  | The payment method was successfully stored with all payment services and the `id` can now be used to create new transactions.                                                                                        |
| `used`                    | The payment method was used in a one-off transaction and it was not vaulted with any payment service.                                                                                                                |

# State diagram

The following state diagram serves as an overview of all the different `status`
values and how they relate to each other.

:::note

The `processing_failed` status has been left out of this diagram as too many
statuses can lead to this outcome.
