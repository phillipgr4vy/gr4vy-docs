title: Remove a buyer

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";

A buyer can be removed from Gr4vy by calling the
[`DELETE /buyers/{buyer_id}`][api] API.

:::info Associated resources

Although this API removes the buyer resource, it does not delete any associated
payment methods and transactions. Instead, it only disassociates these from the
buyer resource.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="curl"
  values={[
    { label: 'cURL', value: 'curl', },
    { label: 'Node', value: 'node', },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl -i -X DELETE "https://api.{gr4vyId}.gr4vy.app/buyers/77a76f7e-d2de-4bbc-ada9-d6a0015e6bd5" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node">

```js
await client.deleteBuyer("77a76f7e-d2de-4bbc-ada9-d6a0015e6bd5");
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The API returns an empty response once the buyer was removed.
