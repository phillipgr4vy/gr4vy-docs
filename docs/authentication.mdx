Gr4vy uses **Bearer (Token) Authentication ** to authenticate any API request.
The tokens used in these requests are **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** that can be
created server side. All API requests must be made over HTTPS and any API calls
made to HTTP will not be accepted.

In this guide we will show you how to:

- [Use Bearer (Token) Authentication](#authenticate-an-api-call) to authenticate
  a single API call.
- [Create the cryptographic key-pair](#create-an-api-key-pair) used to sign a
  JWT.
- With a key-pair in hand you can then either
  - [Use an SDK to create a JWT](#jwt-using-sdk) which is by far the easier
    option.
  - [Or manually create JWT](#manual-jwt) in case you can't to use our SDKs.

available in your programming language to create and validate them.

## Authenticate an API call

Every Gr4vy APIs that requires authentication expect `authorization` HTTP-header
with a signed JWT token as it's value (prefixed with `bearer`).

```bash {2}
curl -i -X GET "https://api.{gr4vyId}.gr4vy.app/transactions" \
    -H "authorization: bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
```

## Create an API key-pair

To sign a JWT you will need to register a new cryptographic key-pair with your
Gr4vy instance. A key-pair consist of the public and a private keys that will be
used to sign (and subsequently verify) the JWT.

To create a new API key-pair visit the **Integrations** panel in your admin
console and generate and download a new API key-pair. You can store the key-pair
with your code or store it in a secure environment accessible to your
application.

## JWT using SDK

JWTs can be generated using one of our SDKs, or manually using a compatible JWT
library. For your convenience we recommend using one of our SDKs as they make
the process a lot easier.

First, install the SDK.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="node"
  values={[
    { label: 'Node', value: 'node', },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="node">

```bash
npm install @gr4vy/node --save
# or: yarn install @gr4vy/node
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, initialize the client with your private key and generate the token.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="node"
  values={[
    { label: 'Node', value: 'node', },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="node">

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const { Client } = require("@gr4vy/node");
const key = String(fs.readFileSync("./private.key"));

const client = new Client({
  gId: "acme",
  privateKey: key,
});

const token = client.getBearerToken(["transactions.read"]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Automatic authentication using SDKs

The SDKs actually make it easy to make direct API calls without needing to use
the token. Still, generating a token to be used outside of the SDK can be useful
in a micro-services architecture. In all other situations use the built-in SDK
methods for making an API call.

:::

## Manual JWT

In some cases you might not want to use one of our SDKs, or an SDK in your
language might not be available. In those cases you can construct, and sign the
JWT with one of the many libraries available on [`jwt.io`](https://jwt.io).

At the high level a JWT is build up out of 3 pieces:

- A **header** defining the algorithm and key used to create the JWT.
- A set of **claims** that define the token's scope and other permissions.
- A cryptographic **signature** based on the header and the claims, signed using
  your private key.

Combine, these 3 pieces make up the JSON Web Token (JWT). See
[`jwt.io`](https://jwt.io) for more details on the specification and available
libraries for generating JWTs.

### JWT header

The JWT header defines the type of encryption algorithm as well as the private
key used to generate the signature.

```json title="Header"
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "ES512",
  "kid": "d757c76acbd74b56"
}
```

:::note values

The `typ` and `alg` are fixed and do not allow for other values. The `kid` is
the ID of your private key, which you can find in the **Integrations** panel of
your dashboard. The `kid` is also the so-called _thumbprint_ of your JWT
key. Some libraries can automatically calculate this thumbprint based off the
private key.

:::

### JWT claims

The claims define when the token was created and what access it has.

```json title="Claims"
{
  "iss": "My JWT Generation Tool",
  "nbf": 1607976645,
  "exp": 1607976314,
  "jti": "0fe1fb1b-2f7e-4c8d-b0eb-aae5d0ec98f7",
  "scopes": ["transactions.read"],
  "embed": {
    "amount": "200",
    "currency": "USD",
    "buyer_id": "d757c76a-cbd7-4b56-95a3-40125b51b29c"
  }
}
```

### Supported JWT claims

The API supports the following JWT claims.

|          | Description                                                                                                         | Required |
| -------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- |
| `iss`    | A unique ID that represents your code making this call. This helps identify what library made an API call to Gr4vy. | Yes      |
| `nbf`    | The unix timestamp that this token was created at.                                                                  | Yes      |
| `exp`    | The unix timestamp that this token expires at.                                                                      | Yes      |
| `jti`    | A random unique ID used for cryptographic entropy. This needs to be unique between API calls.                       | Yes      |
| `scopes` | A list of scopes that give this token access to the API.                                                            | Yes      |
| `data`   | A dictionary of key-value pairs used to pin the amount, currency, and buyer info for use in Gr4vy Embed.            | No       |

### Supported scopes

The API supports the following values for the `scopes` claims.

| Scope               | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*.read`            | Allows read-access to any resource. This is used by default in the SDKs                                                                            |
| `*.write`           | Allows write-access to any resource. This is used by default in the SDKs. This does not also allow read access.                                    |
| `{resource_name}.read`  | Allows read-access to a type or resource. For example, `payment-services.read` enabled read-access for buyers data.                                          |
| `{resource_name}.write` | Allows write-access to a type or resource. For example, `payment-services.write` enabled write-access for buyers data. This does not also allow read access. |
| `embed`             | A scope that represents all the access needed by Gr4vy Embed.                                                                                      |

### Signature & assembly

Finally, the JWT signature is generated by appending the Base64-encoded header
and claims (separated with a `.`) and run it through the `ES256` algorithm.

```
ECDSASHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  public_key,
  private_key
)
```

The assembled JWT is then formed by appending the Base64-encoded header, claims,
and signature separated by a full stop.

```
base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload) + "." + base64UrlEncode(signature)
```
