**Universal 3-D Secure** is also available without Gr4vy Embed as long as any
payment service has been [set up](setup) for 3-D Secure.

## Usage

All you need to do to use 3-D Secure via the API is to [set up](setup) 3-D
Secure on any of the enabled payment services and pass a `redirect_url` when
creating the transaction.

<Tabs
  groupId="language"
  defaultValue="curl"
  values={[
    { label: 'cURL', value: 'curl', },
    { label: 'Node', value: 'node', },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="curl">

```bash {12}
curl -i -X POST "https://api.{gr4vyId}.gr4vy.app/transactions" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
          "amount": 1299,
          "currency": "USD",
          "payment_method": {
            "method": "card",
            "number": "4111111111111111",
            "expiration_date": "11/25",
            "security_code": "123",
            "redirect_url": "https://example.com/callback",
            "buyer_external_identifier": "user-1234",
          }
        }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node">

```js {17}
var fetch = require("node-fetch");

fetch("https://api.{gr4vyId}.gr4vy.app/transactions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 1299,
    currency: "USD",
    payment_method: {
      method: "card",
      number: "4111111111111111",
      expiration_date: "11/21",
      security_code: "123",
      buyer_external_identifier: "user-1234",
      redirect_url: "https://example.com/callback",
    },
  }),
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With 3-D Secure configured for a payment service, we will automatically detect
if it is required to get the buyer's approval for a transaction. If it is required
the API will return a transaction with the status `buyer_approval_pending` and 
an `approval_url` that the buyer can be sent to.

```json {4,6}
{
  "type": "transaction",
  "id": "869df4fc-a3db-43db-806a-14464d9e6920",
  "status": "buyer_approval_pending",
  "payment_method": {
    "approval_url": "https://embed.{gr4vyId}.gr4vy.app/...",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

You can then redirect the buyer to the `approval_url` and Gr4vy will handle all
the intricacies of 3-D Secure. Once the buyer has approved (or rejected) the
transaction the browser is redirected back to the `redirect_url` that was set
when the transaction was created.

The `redirect_url` will be appended with both a transaction ID and status.

```
https://example.com/callback?gr4vy_transaction_id=123&gr4vy_transaction_status=capture_succeeded
```

We strongly recommend confirming the actual transaction status by fetching the
updated transaction by its `id`.

## Buyers & Billing Details

To optimize 3-D Secure it is highly recommended to provide a buyer with billing
details attached to Gr4vy Embed.

A buyer can be set up via our [`POST /buyers`](../reference#operation/add-buyer)
API. The buyer can then be attached to Gr4vy Embed by using the `buyerId` or
`buyerExternalIdentifier` property. The buyer's name, email address, and billing
address will be used to help reduce buyers being requested to complete a 3-D
Secure challenge.

## Features

For every transaction Gr4vy will handle the following steps.

1. Detect if the selected payment service for this transaction has 3-D Secure
   enabled
1. Detect if the card used in the transaction is enrolled for 3-D Secure
1. Handle the seemless frictionless 3-D Secure flow including the device finger
   printing once the user is redirect to the `approval_url`.
1. Handle the 3-D Secure challenge flow, where a buyer is directed to their bank
   to approve the transaction.
