Gr4vy has a **Universal 3-D Secure** solution that provides merchants with a
flexible way to integrate 3-D Secure with various levels of complexity.
Universal 3-D Secure will automatically handle the device fingerprinting,
redirecting the buyer, as well as handling the different 3-D Secure nuances
between the different payment services.

There are currently 3 ways to integrate 3-D Secure.

- [Gr4vy Embed](embed) will automatically detect 3-D Secure for a transaction
  and handle all the user interaction to complete the transaction.
- [Hosted 3-D Secure](hosted) offers 3-D Secure via our API, allowing you to
  capture your own card data but then rely on Gr4vy's hosted 3-D Secure to
  handle the user interaction.
- [External](external) 3-D Secure data can be passed to Gr4vy if you want to create
  your own card checkout experience including your own 3-D Secure integration.

:::info PCI Compliance

Only [Gr4vy Embed](embed) provides a fully PCI compliant solution. The other 2
integrations would require you to go through your own PCI certification.
