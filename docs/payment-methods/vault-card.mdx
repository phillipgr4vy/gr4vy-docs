title: Vault a card

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";

Filling in card details can be a tedious task for most users. To make this
easier we offer the ability to vault a card with Gr4vy. When a card is vaulted
we store (sometimes called "tokenize") the card with all your card payment
services. Once this is done the card can be used in a transaction without having
to request these details from the buyer again.

:::info Gr4vy Embed

When using [Gr4vy Embed][embed] we automatically take care of this for you and
make it possible for a recurring customer to re-use a card they previously used
in your app. The card is automatically vaulted and bound to the buyer ID or
external ID provided.

:::

A card can be stored in Gr4vy by calling the [`POST /payment-methods`][api] API.
The call requires a `method`, the card `number`, its `security_code`, and its
`expiration_date`.

curl -i -X POST "https://api.{gr4vyId}.gr4vy.app/payment-methods" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "method": "card",
        "number": "4111111111111111",
        "expiration_date": "11 / 22",
        "security_code": "123",
      }'
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node">

```js
const request = new CardRequest();
request.method = "card";
request.number = "4111111111111111";
request.expirationDate = "11/22";
request.securityCode = "123";

const paymentMethod = await client.storePaymentMethod(request);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The API returns [the details for the newly vaulted card][api].

:::info Link to buyer

The API also accepts a `buyer_id` or `buyer_external_identifier` which can be
used to associate a card to a previously created [buyer].
