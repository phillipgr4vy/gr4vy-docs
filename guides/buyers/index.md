In Gr4vy, a **buyer** represents your customer. This is the shopper who's performing
a checkout and making a purchase.

## Features

A buyer can be used to perform the following tasks.

* Display a human readable name (`display_name`) for a buyer in the Gr4vy admin
  panel when browsing transactions.
* Associate multiple stored payment methods (cards, PayPal, etc) with a single
  customer.
* Initialize [Gr4vy Embed](/guides/web-quick-start/embed) with the buyer ID to automatically
  displaying the buyer's previously stored payment methods, allowing for faster checkout.
