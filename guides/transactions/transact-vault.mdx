A transaction can be created with a previously stored [payment method][guides].
The call requires an `amount`, `currency`, and a `payment_method` with a `id`.
This token can represent a card, or any other payment method that supports
tokenization.

:::note

Check out our [guides] to learn more about payment methods and the ability to
tie a payment method to a buyer.

This API will return the [authorized transaction][authorize]. The status of this
transaction can vary for a few reasons including the status provided by the
payment service, as well as the requested `intent`.
