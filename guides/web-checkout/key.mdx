Before your application can communicate with the Gr4vy API you will need to
create a new API key. The Gr4vy API handles authentication using a signed **JSON
Web Token** (also called a JWT) which is passed as in a HTTP header.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.{gr4vyId}.gr4vy.app/transactions \
  -H "authorization: bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIi..."
```

:::info We recommend you use an SDK

Our SDKs makes this process a lot easier and is probably available in your
preferred programming language. We will get to this in the next steps.

## Create a new private key

To use the API you will need to generate a new **private API key**. Head over to
your Gr4vy dashboard and visit the **Integrations** page.

On this page, click the "Generate" button and you will be shown a new private
key and a key ID. You will need to store these securely as we will not show
these to you again.

## Summary

In this step you:

- Learned how Gr4vy authenticates API calls.
- Created a new private key for the API.
- Stored this API key in a secure place where your application can access it.
