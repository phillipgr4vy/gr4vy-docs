Gr4vy ships with 3 built-in environments:

- `production` - The default environment intended for use within your live
  application.
- `staging` - An additional environment intended for use within your test or
  quality assurance systems.
- `development` - The final environment intended for use by developers testing
  their transactions.

You can use these environments to test payment services, card rules, and other
settings in 1 environment, before migrating them to another.

## Why environments?

Environments are an essential part of any development process. Your developer
might run your application on their development machine, and to try and test the
Gr4vy integration they will want to try and create some payments. To stop your
Gr4vy dashboard from being populated with lots of dummy data it would be best
for the developer to create their test transactions against the `development`
environment instead.

Similarly, as part of your process you might deploy your application to a QA or
testing environment where you run either automated or manual tests against the
API. To stop this from interfering with your development or live environments
you could set these tests to run against the `staging` environment.

:::info Environments vs Credential Mode

A Gr4vy environment **does not determine** if a transaction is run against the
payment processor's sandbox environment or not. All the Gr4vy environment does
is determine the environment within Gr4vy in which a resource is created or
retrieved. The actual mode (sandbox vs live) that is used to connect to the
payment service is called the **credentials mode**.

## Default production environment

The default environment for any API call is the `production` environment. This
means that if you make an API call to get the list of buyers or payment methods
the API will return the list of buyers and payment methods that were created in
the `production` environment. Similarly, if you were to create a transaction it
will be processed by the payment services in the production environment.

## Payment services and environments

When a payment service is configured it's normally only available in the
production environment. It can be set to be available in the other environments
as well.

## Switching environment

To allow changing of the environment, some of the API endpoints support passing
in an `environment` parameter to either retrieve or create items in a certain
environment. For example, the
[`POST /transactions`](/#operation/authorize-new-transaction) endpoint allows a
transaction to be created with payment services configured in any environment.

```bash {8}
curl -i -X POST "https://api.{gr4vyId}.gr4vy.app/transactions" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
          "amount": 1299,
          "currency": "USD",
          "intent": "capture",
          "environment": "development",
          "payment_method": {
            "method": "card",
            "number": "4111111111111111",
            "expiration_date": "11/25",
            "security_code": "123"
          }
        }'
```
